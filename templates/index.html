    <h1>Welcome to the carpathians...</h1>
    <div class="mx-5 my-4 px-5">
        <p>During a visit to your grandparents in Eastern Europe, you decided to go backpacking for the weekend, looking for a certain waterfall that, acording to a local legend, could grant wishes.</p>
        <p>After many hours walking the countryside, you lose track of time when, all of the sudden, a storm drives you to a castle on top of a hill.</p>
        <p>Since you can't find it in your map, you wander wether going inside is a good or bad idea. Soaking wet, you decide to take your chances.</p>
        <p>"How bad can it be? Certainly, it can't be haunted, right?" But it can be, and it is indeed... haunted! In order to see daylight again, you'll have to face the castle's owner in a very peculiar game of wits. Are you ready to go on?</p>
